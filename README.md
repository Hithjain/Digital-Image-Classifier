# Digital-Image-Classifier
Digital Image Organization has become a crucial aspect in the modern
era, considering the boom of social media websites and information
technology. Managing digital images manually using traditional file explorers
is becoming increasingly difficult and hectic as the number of images in the
storage keeps growing almost daily. Thus, the automated organization of
images is certainly the need of the hour and can greatly help users in
organizing and looking for digital images.
We propose to build an automated digital image organizer which will
firstly categorize the images as facial and non-facial images. The facial
images will be further grouped into separate directories for each distinct
individual. The non-facial images will also be further categorized as
documents, memes, and screenshots. We are specifically choosing these
three categories as according to our survey, they make up for the majority
of the images shared in recent times. We aim to use deep-learning-based
techniques to perform the image classifications. All the unclassified images
will be moved into a distinct folder. Thus, the image organizer application
will essentially take as input, a single folder containing the unorganized
images, it will process and classify the images, and then finally it will
organize all the images into separate directories based on the categories
mentioned above. We aim to make the image organizer as efficient and user
friendly as possible.
